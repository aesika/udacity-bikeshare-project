# Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This Project is related to Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program (DAND). It uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It import the data and answer interesting questions about Bike share system by computing descriptive statistics.
# How to run the scripts
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE). This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of Python installer. To read the files, the following software requirements apply:

- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

# The Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of DAND. After downloading the datasets, place them in the same folder with this Python script.

The data is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), which is a bike share system provider in the United States of America. The data files for all the three cities contain the same following six columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

# Files

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
- bikeshare.py

# Questions explored

The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

- What is the most popular month for start time?
- What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
- What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
- What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
- What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
- What is the most popular trip?
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of gender?
- What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
